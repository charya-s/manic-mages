# Manic Mages
Pixel-art dungeon-crawler/rogue-like game for Desktop and Android. Created using C# in Godot 4.2.

Players control a some-what evil mage making their way through heavily defended civilian buildings/structures in search of loot. The loot obtained upon completion of maps depends on how fast the player reached the end.

Before entering a structure, players can choose their equipment and spells (limited spell slots). Some spells are particularly useful in certain maps to bypass sections or puzzles, and so preparation is important for achieving the best times.
